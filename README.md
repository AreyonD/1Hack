Hey guys,
I created a desktop application for 1Hack using Electron. 
## What is this application then?
It is a way of keeping you connected to the forum. All you have to do is click on the shortcut on your desktop and you get all the new guides , tutorials and tools we developed just for you.
## How to install?
### Windows
Go to the [releases section](https://github.com/ahmedayman4a/1Hack/releases) and download the latest .exe setup file.

* If you have windows smart screen enabled it will tell you not to trust this app , just click run anyway , this is because this app isn't EV CodeSigned which would cost at least 200$ a year. So I either buy this codesigning certifcate (which I can't afford) or this app gets a lot of installs as smart screen is a reputation based system.
### Debian Based Linux Distros (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.)
Go to the [releases section](https://github.com/ahmedayman4a/1Hack/releases) and download the latest .deb file.
### Redhat based distros (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL, etc.) and openSuSE distro
Go to the [releases section](https://github.com/ahmedayman4a/1Hack/releases) and download the latest .rpm file.
### What about MacOS?
Unfortunately I don't have a MacOS system to publish this program for MacOS. If you have one and want to help me publish this app for MacOS email me ([ahmedayman4a77@gmail.com](mailto:ahmedayman4a77@gmail.com))
## How to enable push notifications?
Open account settings >> Click on Notifications >> Under Live Notifications click on enable notifications. If you see [Disable Notifications] this means notifications are already enabled.
